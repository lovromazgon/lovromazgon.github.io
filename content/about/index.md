title: "About"

I'm Lovro, a software engineer specializing in Go, distributed systems, and
data streaming. My professional philosophy is simple: I build tools for
developers that I would love to use myself. This user-first perspective allows
me to anticipate needs, simplify debugging and create intuitive, powerful
engineering experiences.

In my most recent role as the Tech Lead for [Conduit](https://conduit.io), an
open-source data streaming application, I led a four-person engineering team
while owning the project's architecture and execution. I thrive in roles where I
can be both a hands-on contributor and a mentor. I lead by example, writing code
and explaining the "why" behind my decisions, but I also rely on my team's
feedback to challenge and improve my own work. For me, lifting up the team is
the best way to ensure we all succeed.

I'm a big open-source enthusiast. I value the transparency of being able to see
a tool's source code and the empowerment that comes from being able to fix a
bug or implement a feature myself rather than waiting on a vendor.

Away from the keyboard, I enjoy playing the piano, cooking, and hiking with my
border collie, Link. These are the things that help me switch off and recharge,
whether it's getting lost in a piece of music or exploring a new trail.

I'm currently exploring the potential of AI and LLMs to reduce overhead in
development lifecycles. If you're passionate about building developer-first
tools, believe in the power of open-source, or just want to connect, I'd be
happy to chat.
